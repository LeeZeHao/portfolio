## Description
A dynamic and simple to use graphic front end for local LLMs.      
Supports the Windows platform. Developed using Unity 6. Tested with KoboldCPP running bartowski/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-GGUF.

## Achievements
- Wrote a Unity project with C# scripting to augment locally hosted LLM (Large Language Model) with use of KoboldAI REST API, to provide an intuitive and responsive graphical user interface for local AI interaction.
- Leveraged local LLM capabilities to detect up to 6 customizable emotions in bot response, and dynamically display the correct graphics for the bot.
- Developed system for users to customize the bot graphics, by loading custom images for the bot, background and different emotions, increasing flexibility to suit different users’ needs.
- Implemented speech-to-text with whisper.cpp and long term memory with dialog summaries, expanding the bot’s context capabilities and leading to a more fluid experience for user input.
